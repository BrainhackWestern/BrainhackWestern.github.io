      This joint tutorial will cover both the basics of diffusion
      MRI and functional MRI. For diffusion MRI, the basics of processing data
      from MRI acquisitions to computing diffusion tensors and tracking the
      structural connectome will be covered. For functional MRI, the basics of
      what aspect of brain function fMRI measures to considerations for
      preprocessing fMRI data will be presented.

      This micro-workshop (based on MIT's impact course) will cover what an
      impact statement is in the context of research. Most of the workshop will
      be devoted to attendees working in small groups drafting impact statements
      for their own research suitable for the proverbial elevator pitch or
      meet-and-greet scenarios.

      Meta-analyses of neuroimaging data are a good way to get started with
      understanding neuroimaging and task-based neural processing, as well as,
      answer research questions that may not be easily addressed with by
      traditional data collection. This tutorial will cover the various aspects
      of designing a meta-analysis and some of the more popular methods,
      including both topic- and contrast-based meta-analyses and coordinate- and
      image-based meta-analyses. Some hands-on work with the python-based tool
      NiMARE with a sample dataset will be included to help attendees appreciate
      some of the nuances between the various types of meta-analyses. A new,
      web-driven all-in-one meta-analysis toolbox will also be introduced.

      Handling data can be a challenge, and it's best to think about it before
      you need to organize it on a deadline. In this tutorial you'll learn best
      practices for collecting, storing, processing, and sharing your data.
      We'll go over writing a Data Management Plan, formatting your data with
      BIDS and other open standards, and version controlling your data with
      DataLad, and uploading to a public repository.

          github: switt4
      description: |
        While most of the steps to create a valid BIDS (Brain Imaging Data
        Structure) directory can be automated, the events.tsv file containing
        all of the experimental task information still needs to be largely dealt
        with manually. Making this process a bit more difficult is that for
        tasks that cannot be easily parameterized using just reaction time and
        correct responses, the current documentation is limited. For this
        project, I would like to gather anyone who is at the point of needing to
        make an events.tsv file for their own study and work on creating more
        user-friendly documentation for completing the events.tsv file with more
        real-world examples. And, if we decide it is needed, we will develop the
        framework for an app that will help researchers take their existing
        experimental output files and create a valid events.tsv file.

      description: |
        My project has to do with skull-stripping fetal fMRI data - traditional
        tools don't work on fetal fMRI because of the surrounding tissue and the
        lack of a clear skull, which means 1000s of hours are spent manually
        segmenting the brain. There are some tools available, but they don't
        work well and still result in many hours spent fixing the automatic
        segmentations. I'm hoping to improve upon available tools so that
        automated segmentation works.

        Intracellular electrophysiology experiments - specifically patch-clamp
        and its associated methodology - produce immense datasets consisting of
        highly structured time-series data. While many sub-fields of
        neuroscience have adopted standardized beginner-friendly computational
        analyses/tools, the intracellular patch-clamp field still lacks
        standardized & beginner-friendly analyses. Many intracellular papers
        rely on manual analysis with proprietary tools/code. For this brainhack
        project, we will build a [jupyter
        book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) outlining some basic analysis
        that can be done on patch-clamp data, with a focus on building pipelines
        for batch analysis of patch-clamp data. The tutorials will utilize
        open-source tools from various sources, including the Allen institute!

    - title: Quality Control Visualization App
      organizers:
        - name: Peter Van Dyken
          github: pvandyken
      description: |
        Many automated pipelines include some sort of HTML based Quality Control
        output, allowing you to quickly scan through visualizations of the
        results. These are all in-house, custom solutions; there's no easy way
        to generate nice QC interfaces without manually creating html files. The
        goal of this project is to design a ReactJS based webapp that reads a
        JSON file containing a structured account of all the data to be
        displayed. For instance, the json would have paths to all the images to
        be displayed, organized by view, subject, contrast, task, or any other
        arbitrary dimension. The web app would automatically organize all of the
        data into a clean, modern web app interface, allowing the user to view
        the data along any dimension. In other words, you could easily view all
        the different contrasts from a single subject, with a given view, or
        view all the subjects across a given condition, or any other arbitray
        "slice" of the data.

        An app of this nature will be fairly complicated, so the goal during
        Brainhack would be to build a very basic prototype. Knowledge of
        Typescript (a typed superset of Javascript) and ReactJS will be helpful,
        but anyone interested in learning web app development is welcome.
        Knowledge or interest in graphic design (especially user interfaces)
        would also be useful.

      description: |
        Being confused, freezing, or panicking while trying hard to stop,
        re-direct, or stabilize a drone (or any such robot/toy) in sudden
        counter-intuitive poses or environmental conditions is likely a
        relatable experience for all of us. The idea here is about enhancing the
        expression of our intent while controlling a robot remotely — either in
        real life or on a computer screen (simulation) — while not replacing the
        primary instrument of control (modality) but instead by also integrating
        our brain states (thought) in the control loop as measured, for example,
        through EEG. Specifically, for the scope of the hackathon, this could
        mean developing a brain-machine interface for automatically assisting
        the operator in emergency cases with “smart” control command reflexes or
        “takeovers”. Such an approach can be beneficial in high-risk cases such
        as remote handling of materials in nuclear facilities or it can also aid
        the supervision of autonomous control, say in the context of
        self-driving cars, to ultimately increase safety.

        For now, we could pick a particular type of simulated robot (industrial
        arms, RC cars, drones, etc.) and focus on designing and implementing a
        paradigm for characterizing intended motion and surprise during
        undesired motion in both autonomous (with no user control but robot's
        self- and environmental influences) or semi-autonomous cases (including
        user's control commands), i.e., we can aim to measure intent and
        surprise given the user's control commands, the brain states, and robot
        states during algorithmically curated cases of robot motion. This will
        help us detect such situations and also infer desired reactions to
        accordingly adjust control commands to achieve desired reactions during
        emergencies and, more generally, to augment real-time active control to
        match the desired motion. We can strive to keep the approach suitable
        for generalizing well enough to robots of other types and/or
        morphologies and to more unusual environments.

        "What does the inferior frontal gyrus do?" Googling this question
        returns 93,400,000 results. A skim read of paper abstracts will give you
        some ideas about its functions. But wouldn't it be useful to have an
        interactive map where you can explore these functions in the brain?
        Imagine clicking on a brain region and getting a word cloud of functions
        that this region is highly involved in. That's what we will build!

        We will create an interactive tool, useful for anyone wanting to explore
        their own functional data or openly available functional datasets.
        Together with our functional fusion toolbox (in-house & soon to be
        released), it lets you integrate information from many different openly
        available datasets (Human Connectome Project, etc).

        During the project you will be able to use our existing toolbox to
        explore these large datasets - as well as your own data! In addition,
        this interactive map will provide a side by side view of your desired
        brain regions and their connections with other brain regions. Click on a
        region and you get a map of its functional connectivity to all other
        regions in the brain.

        The tool will help synthesize findings across studies (think Neurosynth,
        but directly based on fMRI data) and aid interpretation of results as
        well as planning of future experiments.

        Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a variant of the standard MRI
        sequence examining the diffusion rate of water molecules.  DWI or
        Diffusion MRI has allowed for the improved study of white matter
        pathways across both diseased and healthy patients.

        The goal of the diffusion Fiducials or dFIDs project is to identify a
        set of anatomical landmarks on a variety of Diffusion-Weighted MRI
        images that are both salient and have functional significance.  This
        will be an extension of the previous Anatomical Fiducials (AFIDs)
        project that has localized a set of 32 clinically-relevant landmarks in
        humans, macaques, and PD patients in multiple imaging acquisitions (see
        https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24693).

        We are looking for students, researchers, and clinicians to determine
        potential fiducials across various acquisition types and models in DWI.
        Those with experience in acquiring diffusion images or who have an
        interest in neuroimaging or anatomy are welcome to join!

        to choose particular media to visualize diffusion within as well as to
        change parameters such as diffusion time and membrane permeability. The
        use of such a visualizer will be didactic or for researchers to better

        FunctionalSight will allow researchers to (1) use eye tracking data to
        get components of eye movements and (2) regress these eye movement
        components into high-resolution fMRI data to understand how the brain
        stem controls the eyes. We will dive into high-resolution fMRI data
        acquired at Western and combine it with in-scanner eye tracking data to
        build a model that can show us the neural signatures of eye movements.
        Researchers will be able to use the model for their own eye tracking and
        fMRI data to better understand the neural basis of visual perception
        attention or reading. A guaranteed eye opening experience!
