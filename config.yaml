  - question: What is a "Brainhack"?
    answer: |
      Brainhack is an academically and open science oriented hackathon which connects researchers
      from across many different disciplines to work together on innovative
      projects related to neuroscience. For more details and examples of past
      Brainhack projects click

      Please bring your own laptop, cables, chargers, USB sticks, and some form
      of identification (e.g. Student card or Driver's licence). Also bring
      anything else you may need to work on your project (hardware, datasets
      etc.).
  - question: What if I don't know how to code?
    answer: |
      Learning is an important component of a Brainhack. There will be tutorials
      and experts around to answer questions.
  - question: What if I can't attend all three days?
    answer: |
      You are welcome to attend as much or as little as your schedule allows.
      We understand that Brainhack Western 2023 is scheduled during a busy part
      of the academic year, so we have tried to scheduled breaks each day to
      give attendees time to decompress and attend to their own work.

      understanding neuroimaging and task-based neural processing, as well as,
      answer research questions that may not be easily addressed with by
      traditional data collection. This tutorial will cover the various aspects
      of designing a meta-analysis and some of the more popular methods,
      including both topic- and contrast-based meta-analyses and coordinate- and
      image-based meta-analyses. Some hands-on work with the python-based tool
      NiMARE with a sample dataset will be included to help attendees appreciate
      some of the nuances between the various types of meta-analyses. A new,
      web-driven all-in-one meta-analysis toolbox will also be introduced.

      Handling data can be a challenge, and it's best to think about it before
      you need to organize it on a deadline. In this tutorial you'll learn best
      practices for collecting, storing, processing, and sharing your data.
      We'll go over writing a Data Management Plan, formatting your data with
      BIDS and other open standards, and version controlling your data with
      DataLad, and uploading to a public repository.

      informative graphics, and how to use one of a selection of tools to
      combine your design and data into a paper-ready graphic. We'll go over
      tools in Python, but most of the concepts should be transferable to your

      Using a workflow management tool to run your research analyses can make it
      much easier to remember what you've done with your data, make small
      adjustments, and describe your analyses to others in a reproducible way.
      In this tutorial, you'll learn about what a workflow management tool is,
      why you might want to use one, and how to write your analyses as
      workflows. As an example, we'll go over SnakeBIDS, a Western-grown
      workflow management tool for handling BIDS-formatted neuroimaging data.

      In this tutorial, we will begin with a basic introduction to neuroanatomy
      then briefly discuss the hippocampus, basal ganglia structures, midbrain,
      and relatively uncharted zona incerta. Taking on a clinical lens, we will
      explore how these structures could be crucial targets during functional
      neurosurgical procedures.

      We end our tutorial with 3 mini-software demo stations:

      1. Learning neuroanatomy using an open and validated anatomical fiducial
         framework ([AFIDs](https://validator.afids.io/))
      2. Reviewing introduced anatomy in the context of a surgical case using a
         virtual reality headset
      3. Applying our functional neuroanatomy knowledge to plan a surgical case
         using a fully open-source software
         ([trajectoryGuide](https://trajectoryguide.greydongilmore.com/)).

      This tutorial will explore the essentials of EEG, including its origin,
      conventions and related modalities. From there, we'll step into the world
      of EEG analysis, from time domain to time-frequency analysis, all while
      getting hands-on sessions with Python. Finally, the tutorial will cover a
      bit on the important role of preprocessing in EEG. Discover the
      fascinating world of EEG with Python.

    - title: BIDS - Creating the events.tsv file
      organizers:
        - name: Suzanne Witt
          github: switt4
      description: |
        While most of the steps to create a valid BIDS (Brain Imaging Data
        Structure) directory can be automated, the events.tsv file containing
        all of the experimental task information still needs to be largely dealt
        with manually. Making this process a bit more difficult is that for
        tasks that cannot be easily parameterized using just reaction time and
        correct responses, the current documentation is limited. For this
        project, I would like to gather anyone who is at the point of needing to
        make an events.tsv file for their own study and work on creating more
        user-friendly documentation for completing the events.tsv file with more
        real-world examples. And, if we decide it is needed, we will develop the
        framework for an app that will help researchers take their existing
        experimental output files and create a valid events.tsv file.
    - title: Automated skull-stripping fetal MRI data
      organizers:
        - name: Emily Nichols
      description: |
        My project has to do with skull-stripping fetal fMRI data - traditional
        tools don't work on fetal fMRI because of the surrounding tissue and the
        lack of a clear skull, which means 1000s of hours are spent manually
        segmenting the brain. There are some tools available, but they don't
        work well and still result in many hours spent fixing the automatic
        segmentations. I'm hoping to improve upon available tools so that
        automated segmentation works.

        Building a Jupyter Book tutorial for intracellular electrophysiology
        analysis in python

      description: |
        Intracellular electrophysiology experiments - specifically patch-clamp
        and its associated methodology - produce immense datasets consisting of
        highly structured time-series data. While many sub-fields of
        neuroscience have adopted standardized beginner-friendly computational
        analyses/tools, the intracellular patch-clamp field still lacks
        standardized & beginner-friendly analyses. Many intracellular papers
        rely on manual analysis with proprietary tools/code. For this brainhack
        project, we will build a [jupyter
        book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) outlining some basic analysis
        that can be done on patch-clamp data, with a focus on building pipelines
        for batch analysis of patch-clamp data. The tutorials will utilize
        open-source tools from various sources, including the Allen institute!
        An early form of the notebooks can be found
        [here](https://www.smestern.com/PCCA_demo/intro.html).
    - title: Quality Control Visualization App
      organizers:
        - name: Peter Van Dyken
          github: pvandyken
      description: |
        Many automated pipelines include some sort of HTML based Quality Control
        output, allowing you to quickly scan through visualizations of the
        results. These are all in-house, custom solutions; there's no easy way
        to generate nice QC interfaces without manually creating html files. The
        goal of this project is to design a ReactJS based webapp that reads a
        JSON file containing a structured account of all the data to be
        displayed. For instance, the json would have paths to all the images to
        be displayed, organized by view, subject, contrast, task, or any other
        arbitrary dimension. The web app would automatically organize all of the
        data into a clean, modern web app interface, allowing the user to view
        the data along any dimension. In other words, you could easily view all
        the different contrasts from a single subject, with a given view, or
        view all the subjects across a given condition, or any other arbitray
        "slice" of the data.

        An app of this nature will be fairly complicated, so the goal during
        Brainhack would be to build a very basic prototype. Knowledge of
        Typescript (a typed superset of Javascript) and ReactJS will be helpful,
        but anyone interested in learning web app development is welcome.
        Knowledge or interest in graphic design (especially user interfaces)
        would also be useful.

        Being confused, freezing, or panicking while trying hard to stop,
        re-direct, or stabilize a drone (or any such robot/toy) in sudden
        counter-intuitive poses or environmental conditions is likely a
        relatable experience for all of us. The idea here is about enhancing the
        expression of our intent while controlling a robot remotely — either in
        real life or on a computer screen (simulation) — while not replacing the
        primary instrument of control (modality) but instead by also integrating
        our brain states (thought) in the control loop as measured, for example,
        through EEG. Specifically, for the scope of the hackathon, this could
        mean developing a brain-machine interface for automatically assisting
        the operator in emergency cases with “smart” control command reflexes or
        “takeovers”. Such an approach can be beneficial in high-risk cases such
        as remote handling of materials in nuclear facilities or it can also aid
        the supervision of autonomous control, say in the context of
        self-driving cars, to ultimately increase safety.

        For now, we could pick a particular type of simulated robot (industrial
        arms, RC cars, drones, etc.) and focus on designing and implementing a
        paradigm for characterizing intended motion and surprise during
        undesired motion in both autonomous (with no user control but robot's
        self- and environmental influences) or semi-autonomous cases (including
        user's control commands), i.e., we can aim to measure intent and
        surprise given the user's control commands, the brain states, and robot
        states during algorithmically curated cases of robot motion. This will
        help us detect such situations and also infer desired reactions to
        accordingly adjust control commands to achieve desired reactions during
        emergencies and, more generally, to augment real-time active control to
        match the desired motion. We can strive to keep the approach suitable
        for generalizing well enough to robots of other types and/or
        morphologies and to more unusual environments.

        Application that uses a web-based front end where users can submit brain
        MRI volumes. The data is then processed on the application backend, a 3D
        model is generated, and is then accessible in a AR/VR environment. We
        are using the MERN stack for the web component and C#/Unity for the
        AR/VR application. We would love to work with people who have experience
        with MRI volumetric segmentation or are interested in VR/AR data
        visualization. :slightly_smiling_face:

        "What does the inferior frontal gyrus do?" Googling this question
        returns 93,400,000 results. A skim read of paper abstracts will give you
        some ideas about its functions. But wouldn't it be useful to have an
        interactive map where you can explore these functions in the brain?
        Imagine clicking on a brain region and getting a word cloud of functions
        that this region is highly involved in. That's what we will build!

        We will create an interactive tool, useful for anyone wanting to explore
        their own functional data or openly available functional datasets.
        Together with our functional fusion toolbox (in-house & soon to be
        released), it lets you integrate information from many different openly
        available datasets (Human Connectome Project, etc).

        During the project you will be able to use our existing toolbox to
        explore these large datasets - as well as your own data! In addition,
        this interactive map will provide a side by side view of your desired
        brain regions and their connections with other brain regions. Click on a
        region and you get a map of its functional connectivity to all other
        regions in the brain.

        The tool will help synthesize findings across studies (think Neurosynth,
        but directly based on fMRI data) and aid interpretation of results as
        well as planning of future experiments.
    - title: 'DWI Fiducials'
      organizers:
        - name: Arun Thurairajah
      description: |
        Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a variant of the standard MRI
        sequence examining the diffusion rate of water molecules.  DWI or
        Diffusion MRI has allowed for the improved study of white matter
        pathways across both diseased and healthy patients.

        The goal of the diffusion Fiducials or dFIDs project is to identify a
        set of anatomical landmarks on a variety of Diffusion-Weighted MRI
        images that are both salient and have functional significance.  This
        will be an extension of the previous Anatomical Fiducials (AFIDs)
        project that has localized a set of 32 clinically-relevant landmarks in
        humans, macaques, and PD patients in multiple imaging acquisitions (see
        https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24693).

        We are looking for students, researchers, and clinicians to determine
        potential fiducials across various acquisition types and models in DWI.
        Those with experience in acquiring diffusion images or who have an
        interest in neuroimaging or anatomy are welcome to join!

    - title: DiffSimViz
      description:
        - DiffSimViz (Diffusion Simulator Visualizer) will be a python toolbox with the aim of providing intuitive visualizations of particle diffusion in different media/microstructure. This will ideally include an interface to choose particular media to visualize diffusion within
        - as well as to change parameters such as diffusion time and membrane permeability. The use of such a visualizer will be didactic
        - or for researchers to better understand what their diffusion MRI signal might look like in particular microstructural environments.
