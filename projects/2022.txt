11:T410,Being confused, freezing, or panicking while trying hard to stop,
re-direct, or stabilize a drone (or any such robot/toy) in sudden
counter-intuitive poses or environmental conditions is likely a
relatable experience for all of us. The idea here is about enhancing the
expression of our intent while controlling a robot remotely — either in
real life or on a computer screen (simulation) — while not replacing the
primary instrument of control (modality) but instead by also integrating
our brain states (thought) in the control loop as measured, for example,
through EEG. Specifically, for the scope of the hackathon, this could
mean developing a brain-machine interface for automatically assisting
the operator in emergency cases with “smart” control command reflexes or
“takeovers”. Such an approach can be beneficial in high-risk cases such
as remote handling of materials in nuclear facilities or it can also aid
the supervision of autonomous control, say in the context of
self-driving cars, to ultimately increase safety.6:["$","div",null,{"className":"_1n606ht0","children":[["$","$Le",null,{"displaySections":{"tutorial":false,"schedule":false,"twitterFeed":false},"splashMode":false,"registrationButton":"$Lf","projectUrl":"/projects/2026"}],["$","article",null,{"ref":"$undefined","style":"$undefined","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Projects"}],null,["$","$L10",null,{"years":["2021","2022","2023","2025","2026"],"def":"2022"}],null,[["$","section","Safer-Multimodal-Teleoperation-of-Simulated-Robots",{"id":"Safer-Multimodal-Teleoperation-of-Simulated-Robots","children":[["$","h3",null,{"children":"Safer Multimodal Teleoperation of (Simulated) Robots"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"console ","children":["$","span",null,{"children":[[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$11"}],"\n",["$","p","p-1",{"children":"For now, we could pick a particular type of simulated robot (industrial\narms, RC cars, drones, etc.) and focus on designing and implementing a\nparadigm for characterizing intended motion and surprise during\nundesired motion in both autonomous (with no user control but robot's\nself- and environmental influences) or semi-autonomous cases (including\nuser's control commands), i.e., we can aim to measure intent and\nsurprise given the user's control commands, the brain states, and robot\nstates during algorithmically curated cases of robot motion.
